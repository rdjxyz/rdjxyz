### Hi, I'm [Rick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-d-johnston/). 👋

I'm an email marketing specialist with a keen interest in development.

I've been learning HTML & CSS for the past couple of years and feel like I've got a good grasp on it now.

Currently, I'm learning JavaScript and creating a very niched Chrome extension—something to eliminate a common frustration I have at work every day. (planning on launching it by New Year's day 2023 or mid-January).

After that, I've got another idea in the pipeline to eliminate another common, day-to-day frustration at work!
<!-- Aside from that, I'll be doing Frontend Mentor challenges and building a [portfolio of work](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/rdjxyz) through their platform with repositories hosted here. -->

If you want to connect for whatever reason, the best way to get in touch is to [message me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-d-johnston/).

🍻
